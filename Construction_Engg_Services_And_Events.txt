Construction & Engineering Services + Industry Boards & Conferences

---

1. STRUCTURAL DETAILING  
Precise shop drawings, 3D models, and fabrication details for steel frameworks. Vital for reducing errors and field rework. Serves fabricators and engineers.

2. DELEGATED ENGINEERING  
Design of specialty components (connections, stairs, curtain walls) by licensed engineers. Key for fast-track projects. Serves contractors, fabricators, and subs.

3. ARCHITECTURAL METALS DETAILING  
Custom detailing for stairs, railings, façades, and cladding. Integrates design intent and constructability. Serves architects and specialty fabricators.

4. PEMB DESIGN & DETAILING  
Detailing and modeling services for pre-engineered metal buildings. Works with PEMB manufacturers and contractors. High-volume, repeatable segment.

5. BIM MODELING  
LOD-based structural and façade modeling. Enables clash detection, coordination, and digital delivery. Serves GCs, engineers, and owners.

6. FABRICATION-READY DOCUMENTATION  
Final deliverables for manufacturing: shop drawings, CNC data, bills of material. Essential for accurate fabrication and field assembly.
