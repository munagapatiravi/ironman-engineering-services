You are an expert in software documentation and an accomplished business analyst. Your task is to traverse this codebase and provide a summary of its purpose and mechanism.

Your documentation should include the entire codebase and output a markdown file named after the project name. The document should be as technical and accurate as possible, documenting every part of the system. It should include the following:
    - Application Logic
    - User Process Workflows
    - Features
    - Data Models
    - Integration Points
    - Personas
In an order and context that makes sense.

The document should be sufficiently detailed to facilitate a rewrite of the project in a different technology.

Where applicable, include mermaid diagrams that adhere to the syntax described here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams

Double check all syntax to make sure it will render.

Avoid the following conventions:
    1. DO NOT USE em-dashes. Find a different construction.
    2. Avoid lists of exactly 3 elements
    3. Avoid the sentence structure "not only...but" e.g. "not only does this project help business flow, but it also is great on security"

When the document is complete, do a final pass for these rules.

Use the README.md file as reference for a user's perspective of the operation of the project.
